# **AI Receptionist with Microsoft Semantic Kernel and OpenAI**

Welcome to the **AI Receptionist** project! This repository contains the code and resources needed to build a fully-functional AI receptionist using Microsoft Semantic Kernel and OpenAI. This AI-powered virtual assistant is designed to handle customer interactions, provide information about services, and connect customers with your team, all in a professional manner.

## **Introduction**

This project demonstrates how to build an AI receptionist using the Microsoft Semantic Kernel and OpenAI’s powerful language models. The AI receptionist is capable of understanding natural language, engaging in meaningful conversations, and performing various tasks, such as answering inquiries, managing appointments, and providing company information.

## **Features**

- **Natural Language Understanding:** Responds to user inputs with contextually relevant and accurate information.
- **Customizable Responses:** Easily modify and extend the AI’s responses to suit your business needs.
- **Conversation History:** Maintains a history of interactions to provide coherent and personalized conversations.
- **Enterprise Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with enterprise components like logging and monitoring.
- **Scalable and Adaptable:** Built on scalable infrastructure, allowing for easy adaptation to different business requirements.

## **Technologies Used**

- **[Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel):** The core engine that enables intelligent interaction between the AI model and user inputs.
- **[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/):** Provides state-of-the-art language models for generating human-like text.
- **.NET 8:** The framework used to develop the application.
